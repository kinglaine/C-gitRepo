The prefix increment returns a value after it has been incremented.
Example: int a = 1; then ..
Cout << ++a -> 2
Cout << a --> 2
Here the value is incremented first the it is returned, hence ++a is faster then a++;

The postfix increment returns a value before it has been incremented.
Example: int a = 1; then ..
Cout << a++ --> 1
Count << a --> 2
Here the value Is return first then it is incremented.

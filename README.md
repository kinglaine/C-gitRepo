# CISC 3142 Fall 2022 Class Exercise 5
Prepare a markdown file for the selected textbook exercises and source files for each of the practice problems – each with its own main method. At the completion of this lab exercise, you should have a total of 3 programs.
**During class time, please complete the exercises from the textbook and prepare pseudocode (that includes variable definitions) for the practice problems. If you have additional time, please prepare the source files. Show me your work before you leave. 
### Exercises from the textbook:
### 4.5: Determine the result of the following expressions.
##### (a) -30 * 3 + 21 / 5 
##### (b) -30 + 3 * 21 / 5
##### (c) 30 / 3 * 21 % 5 
##### (d) -30 / 3 * 21 % 4
### 4.17: Explain the difference between prefix and postfix increment.
### 4.34: Given the variable definitions in this section, explain what conversions take place in the following expressions:
##### (a) if (fval) 
##### (b) dval = fval + ival; 
##### (c) dval + ival * cval;

### Practice Problems
#### 1. Sum of Digits
Calculate the sum of digits of a number. The program prompts the user to enter the number. For example: Enter number: 7865 The output should be  7+ 8 + 6 + 5 = 26
Sample output of the program is shown below:
Enter a positive number: 7865
Sum of digits of the number 7865 is: 26
#### 2. Prime Numbers
Write a program that finds and prints all the prime numbers between 3 and 100. A prime number is a number such that 1 and itself are the only numbers that evenly divide it (for example, 3, 5, 7, 11, 13, 17, …).
#### 3. Linear Regression
Write a program that reads a file containing a pair of numbers in each line (representing x y coordinates); at the end of reading this file compute the linear regression for this set of numbers.  Please use to the linear regression formulas mentioned in class (if you missed class, find a classmate to get notes).

# Submission Instructions
Please ensure that when you submit you have the following:
	•	The repository you’re submitting is not entirely new, but a continuation. It should contain at least one other previously submitted exercise. This repository will be the one use for the remainder of the semester. Name changes to the repo is okay, but you should be using one consistent repository for the whole semester. 
####	•	Store exercise 5 files in its own subfolder
####	•	Include pseudocode as either comments in the source file OR markdown files.**
####	•	Prepare a makefile that will be used with the GitHub actions workflow
####	•	Prepare GitHub actions workflow to show execution of your program  (if you cannot get it working, then record script log of your session)
####	•	Do not include executables with your submission (a.out, etc)
